On Perfect Rhymes:

For a rhyme to be considered a 'perfect rhyme', the following must be true:
1) The stressed vowel sound in both words must be identical, as well as any subsequent sounds.
For example, "sky" and "high"; "skylight" and "highlight".

2) The onset of the stressed syllable in the words must differ.
For example, "bean" and "green" is a perfect rhyme, while "leave" and "believe" is not.
