----------------------------------------

General
- add Synonyms coming soon label and disable button

Info/Muting:
- Info screen to explain rating boundaries? - or to say how many you need until next rank
  - where to add info screen, add mute buttons with it?
- Add mute buttons to bottom of screen (in all screens?)

Design:
- Add @2x and 3x monkeylogo.png

-

Rhymes:

- review UI - answer grid item style, spacing on different screens, etc

Bugs:
- see if it works running on device via android studio

Sound Effects:
  - tweak menu button sound? - amplitude/pitch
  - look into different negative sounds - maybe need matching positive and negative?
  - Post Game sounds
  - Rhyme game sounds
  - normalize sounds - negative a bit quieter

----------------------------------------
Future Release
----------------------------------------

General:
- Add Synonyms mode
- Versus Mode
- For iOS add animating spheres also, don't use linear gradient?
- enableProguardInReleaseBuilds, enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture ?
  - look into how to see bundle size/app/apk size https://medium.com/@rishii.kumar.chawda/reduce-your-react-native-app-size-dramatically-5430d773c92f
- Decide on next game mode, Science definitions? Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)
- upgrade react native
- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word
- does there need to be a timeout on the api?
- add X to loading state
- look into adding reselect
- look into making splash screen a gradient
- look into flipper/rn 0.62
- Set different themes in settings menu?
- Add gradient to splash screen?
- Think about other ways to incorporate monkey theme
- keep track of perfect streak
  -> change praise words based on this/show streak
- get elo boundaries from BE?
- Add Word Monkey title to launch screen

Definitions:
- Look into whether rhymes all request approach would be better for definitions also (would increase response size)
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)
- on shuffle fade out answer letters when they disappear?

Rhymes:
- Make get ready text fade in
- fade out countdown at end of game
- fix title moving a tiny bit from pre game -> game
- handle duplicate answer (shimmer/flash animation?)

Potential Features:
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?, give example?, give synonym?)
- add background animated spheres
- Other user stats - % correct, longest streak?

Potential Tweaks:
- Change countdown to pie timer?

Potential Refactors:
- Sort out game and round naming (round should be within a game)
- make countdown logic generic?
- could move ON_EXIT_GAME logic to listen to navigation event instead of timeout
