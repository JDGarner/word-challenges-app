General To Do:
- Improve main menu styling
- Decide on next game mode, Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)

- show green/red letters animation on submit answer
- add score to post game screen
- post game colour red/green answers for correct/incorrect
- add animation to letters on press and on appear/disappear
- Less padding and smaller font for bigger words, don't let it wrap
- add pre-game countdown? or remove pregame state
- increase buffer, increase amount of definitions sent
- add exit to main menu
- progress bar along the bottom (chunks/5)
- Write web scraper for Oxford/cambridge sites

- add extra difficulties
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?)

- Make modes different colours/gradients
- Remove border from given rhyme/definition
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)

Potential Tests to write:
- Rhymes:
  - When current rhyme index reaches buffer, additional rhymes are loaded
  - When there is no next rhyme, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in pregame state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
- Definitions:
  - When current definition index reaches buffer, additional definitions are loaded
  - When there is no next definition, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in playing state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request succeeds > new game starts with new definitions
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
  - Initial request fails > retry fails > retry succeeds > game starts
