----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
Future Release
----------------------------------------

Minor:
- Handle leaderboard connection if network is down
- Think about changing background to be two separate interpolating colours (rather than moving from bottom to top)

General:
- Add Synonyms mode
- Versus Mode
- For iOS add animating spheres also, don't use linear gradient?
- enableProguardInReleaseBuilds, enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture ?
  - look into how to see bundle size/app/apk size https://medium.com/@rishii.kumar.chawda/reduce-your-react-native-app-size-dramatically-5430d773c92f
- Decide on next game mode, Science definitions? Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)
- upgrade react native
- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word
- does there need to be a timeout on the api?
- add X to loading state
- look into adding reselect
- look into making splash screen a gradient
- look into flipper/rn 0.62
- Set different themes in settings menu?
- Add gradient to splash screen?
- Think about other ways to incorporate monkey theme
- keep track of perfect streak
  -> change praise words based on this/show streak
- get elo boundaries from BE?
- Add Word Monkey title to launch screen
- ambient music?

Definitions:
- Look into whether rhymes all request approach would be better for definitions also (would increase response size)
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)
- on shuffle fade out answer letters when they disappear?

Rhymes:
- Make get ready text fade in
- fade out countdown at end of game
- fix title moving a tiny bit from pre game -> game
- handle duplicate answer (shimmer/flash animation?)

Potential Features:
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?, give example?, give synonym?)
- add background animated spheres
- Other user stats - % correct, longest streak?

Potential Tweaks:
- Change countdown to pie timer?

Potential Refactors:
- Sort out game and round naming (round should be within a game)
- make countdown logic generic?
- could move ON_EXIT_GAME logic to listen to navigation event instead of timeout

----------------------------------------
Other
----------------------------------------

2nd Version:
- Compare users score to other players

Pro version with extra game modes? Or just ads?:
- See which might generate more money?

Other Game Modes:
- Words that are often used to describe...
https://www.wordsapi.com/ https://www.datamuse.com/api/
Greek letters mode, scientific symbols?, generic symbols?

Maybe:
- Add you missed suggestions
- add a way for user to contest/suggest rhyme





Potential Tests to write:
- Rhymes:
  - When current rhyme index reaches buffer, additional rhymes are loaded
  - When there is no next rhyme, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in pregame state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
- Definitions:
  - When current definition index reaches buffer, additional definitions are loaded
  - When there is no next definition, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in playing state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request succeeds > new game starts with new definitions
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
  - Initial request fails > retry fails > retry succeeds > game starts
