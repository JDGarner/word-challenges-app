- when countdown hits zero, start new game:
  - would want some post game breakdown/score presenation
  - then a button to start a new game

Pre Game State:
Show 'What Rhymes with...' and a 3, 2, 1
Then transition to Playing state

Post Game State:
show score - correct answers(/total possible?)
New Game button

Animation To Do:
- add green tick/red cross animation
- add animation to timer when it gets bumped (make it enlarge quickly then go back down)
- add some pre-game animation to say What Rhymes with...
- animate duplicate answer (shimmer?)

- when countdown is less than 3, make it red
- sort out spacing for different device sizes, make gap at top %
- countdown on iOS/android position

- api Error handling

- call https://www.datamuse.com/api/ (e.g. https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=list)
- call API with each word, sort in order of most number of rhyming words
- split into easy, medium, hard groups

- if wrong it goes red and bounces to the left or right

- Will need some main menu with mute also?
