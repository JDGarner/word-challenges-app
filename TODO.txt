- look through each screen again carefully




----------------------------------------
Future Release
----------------------------------------

General:
- enableProguardInReleaseBuilds, enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture ?
  - look into how to see bundle size/app/apk size https://medium.com/@rishii.kumar.chawda/reduce-your-react-native-app-size-dramatically-5430d773c92f
- Decide on next game mode, Science definitions? Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)
- upgrade react native
- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word
- does there need to be a timeout on the api?

Definitions:
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)

Potential Features:
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?, give example?, give synonym?)
- add background animated spheres

Potential Refactors:
- Sort out game and round naming (round should be within a game)
- make countdown logic generic?
- could move ON_EXIT_GAME logic to listen to navigation event instead of timeout

----------------------------------------
Other
----------------------------------------

Name Ideas:
- Word Romp
- Word Binge
- Word Play Challenge
- Something like WordScapes/other word puns

2nd Version:
- Compare users score to other players

Pro version with extra game modes? Or just ads?:
- See which might generate more money?

Other Game Modes:

https://www.wordsapi.com/ https://www.datamuse.com/api/
Greek letters mode, scientific symbols?, generic symbols?

Maybe:
- Add you missed suggestions
- add a way for user to contest/suggest rhyme





Potential Tests to write:
- Rhymes:
  - When current rhyme index reaches buffer, additional rhymes are loaded
  - When there is no next rhyme, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in pregame state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
- Definitions:
  - When current definition index reaches buffer, additional definitions are loaded
  - When there is no next definition, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in playing state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request succeeds > new game starts with new definitions
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
  - Initial request fails > retry fails > retry succeeds > game starts
