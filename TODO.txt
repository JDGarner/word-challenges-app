- when countdown hits zero, start new game:
  - would want some post game breakdown/score presenation
  - then a button to start a new game
  - need some wrapped like RhymeGameMode, and a state value gameState
  - gameState can be PreGame, Playing, PostGame, Ended
  - GameMode wrapper renders different components based on gameState
- handle duplicate answers

Animation To Do:
- add green tick/red cross animation
- add animation to timer when it gets bumped
- add some pre-game animation to say What Rhymes with...

Styling To Do:
- ellipses for long text?
- when countdown is less than 3, make it red
- sort out spacing for different device sizes, make gap at top %

- fix/check android version

- api Error handling

- Add tutorial?

- add background animated spheres?

- call https://www.datamuse.com/api/ (e.g. https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=list)
- call API with each word, sort in order of most number of rhyming words
- split into easy, medium, hard groups


- If word is correct - it goes green and flies up
- if wrong it goes red and bounces to the left or right
- add timer, after timer runs out display new word

- Add score
- Add sound effects
- Timer in top left/right, X in top left/right
- Will need some main menu with mute also?

- show correct words somewhere and incorrect somewhere else?

- move all api results into my own db?

- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word

- add a way for user to contest/suggest rhyme



- Add Synonym mode

MVP:
- Rhyme mode
- Synonym mode
