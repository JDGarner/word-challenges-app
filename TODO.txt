Leaderboard/Stats:
- Leaderboard button on main menu

- Stats:
  - ELO for each difficulty level
  - Split ELO levels into leagues - bronze -> diamond with a leaderboard on each one
  - look into how i would add ELO? how I could track/store stats & identify users without accounts
    - on android could use google play accounts?
  - Maybe - Other user stats - % correct, longest streak?

General:
- add difficulties to rhymes?
- splash screen
- Improve main menu styling

----------------------------------------
Future Release
----------------------------------------

General:
- enableProguardInReleaseBuilds, enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture ?
  - look into how to see bundle size/app/apk size https://medium.com/@rishii.kumar.chawda/reduce-your-react-native-app-size-dramatically-5430d773c92f
- Decide on next game mode, Science definitions? Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)
- upgrade react native
- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word
- does there need to be a timeout on the api?
- add X to loading state
- look into adding reselect

Definitions:
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)

Potential Features:
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?, give example?, give synonym?)
- add background animated spheres

Potential Refactors:
- Sort out game and round naming (round should be within a game)
- make countdown logic generic?
- could move ON_EXIT_GAME logic to listen to navigation event instead of timeout

----------------------------------------
Other
----------------------------------------

Name Ideas:
- Word master/ninja/binge/fiend

- Something like WordScapes/other word puns

2nd Version:

Pro version with extra game modes? Or just ads?:
- See which might generate more money?

Other Game Modes:

  - When current rhyme index reaches buffer, additional rhymes are loaded
  - When there is no next rhyme, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in pregame state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
- Definitions:
  - When current definition index reaches buffer, additional definitions are loaded

  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request succeeds > new game starts with new definitions
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
  - Initial request fails > retry fails > retry succeeds > game starts
