----------------------------------------
1st Release
----------------------------------------

- Improve App Design:
  - For iOS add animating spheres also, don't use linear gradient?
  - Test out different sphere/background colour & animation combinations - randomise them a bit?

- splash screen
- add extra game mode coming soon disabled button (or add Synonyms?)
- add app icons and launch screen - https://medium.com/better-programming/react-native-add-app-icons-and-launch-screens-onto-ios-and-android-apps-3bfbc20b7d4c
- Add sound effects & mute (into settings screen)
- add different dev and prod environments with different .env files (see config github)
- read react native docs on releasing before releasing
  - Android release - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android

Definitions:
- re-test retry logic with new difficulty levels
- lock difficulties until completing earlier levels?
- Info icon on each difficulty:
    Novice - Mostly common words, with some letters already filled in
    Journeyman - Mostly common words, no letters filled in
    Expert - Mostly obscure words, with some letters already filled in
    Master - Mostly obscure words, no letters filled in
- Add more feedback text randomly
- Fix Time and Chimera definitions, remove Manichean

Rhymes:
- PreGame:
  - fix get ready animation
- Game:
  - Align header with pre game header
  - Fix answer grid Styling
  - think about text input placement
- Post Game:
  - fix layout
  - add animation to post game screen?
  - add explanation text to the % score
  - replace :( with icon?
- check rhymes on android
- add hate to straight
- add difficulties? - based on number of rhymes for the word?

Leaderboard/Stats:
- Leaderboard button on main menu
- Maybe leaderboard button in each difficulty
- Stats:
  - ELO for each difficulty level
  - Split ELO levels into leagues - bronze -> diamond with a leaderboard on each one
  - look into how i would add ELO? how I could track/store stats & identify users without accounts
    - on android could use google play accounts?
  - Maybe - Other user stats - % correct, longest streak?

Testing:
- test/user test difficulty levels with different clue parameters
- test animation speeds/timings
- test button placement
- test different devices

Maybe in 1st release:
- Add Synonyms mode
- Add tutorial/intro?
- Set different themes in settings menu?


Option 1:
  - Novice - easier words + clues
  - Journeyman - easier words, no clues
  - Expert - harder words + clues
  - Master - harder words, no clues

Potential Tweaks:
- Change countdown to pie timer?
- Change colour/font weight of praise/word in post game screen

Rhymes:
- fix countdown?
- add close button & exit game logic
- post game animation text
- add shimmer animation - correct answers and new given word
- add green tick/red cross animation
- animate duplicate answer (shimmer?)

Bugs:
- cant scroll after click on answer inside grid

Styling To Do:
- ellipses for long text?
- sort out spacing for different device sizes, make gap at top %
- countdown on iOS/android position
- font?
- look through each screen again carefully




----------------------------------------
Future Release
----------------------------------------

General:
- enableProguardInReleaseBuilds, enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture ?
  - look into how to see bundle size/app/apk size https://medium.com/@rishii.kumar.chawda/reduce-your-react-native-app-size-dramatically-5430d773c92f
- Decide on next game mode, Science definitions? Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)
- upgrade react native
- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word
- does there need to be a timeout on the api?
- add X to loading state
- look into adding reselect

Definitions:
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)
- on shuffle fade out answer letters when they disappear?

Potential Features:
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?, give example?, give synonym?)
- add background animated spheres

Potential Refactors:
- Sort out game and round naming (round should be within a game)
- make countdown logic generic?
- could move ON_EXIT_GAME logic to listen to navigation event instead of timeout
