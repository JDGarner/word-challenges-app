General To Do:
- Improve main menu styling
- Decide on next game mode, Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)
- Change countdown to pie timer?
- add some animation on all screens? (faded spheres?)
- add app icons and launch screen - https://medium.com/better-programming/react-native-add-app-icons-and-launch-screens-onto-ios-and-android-apps-3bfbc20b7d4c
- upgrade react native

Potential Refactors:
- make countdown logic generic?

Definitions To Do:
In Game:
- decide on max word size? incontrovertible?
- add animation to letters on press and on appear/disappear
- add shuffle animation
- show green/red letters animation on submit answer
- add score to post game screen
- post game colour red/green answers for correct/incorrect
- increase buffer, increase amount of definitions sent
- Write web scraper for Oxford/cambridge sites
- remove/update Jibe, Paradigm definition
- could move ON_EXIT_GAME logic to listen to navigation event instead of timeout
- Sort out game and round naming (round should be within a game)

- add extra difficulties
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?)

- Make modes different colours/gradients
- Remove border from given rhyme/definition
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)


Rhymes to do:
  - fix countdown
  - add close button & exit game logic

  Animation To Do:
  - post game animation text
  - add shimmer animation - correct answers and new given word
  - add green tick/red cross animation
  - animate duplicate answer (shimmer?)

  Bugs To Fix:
  - cant scroll after click on answer inside grid

  Styling To Do:
  - ellipses for long text?
  - sort out spacing for different device sizes, make gap at top %
  - countdown on iOS/android position
  - add background animated spheres?
  - font?

- Add sound effects? mute?

- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word


Synonym mode:


Defintions Mode:
- User has to type word in for given definition
Easy - easier words
Medium - harder words with clues
Hard - harder words no clues

MVP:
- Rhyme mode
- Synonym mode (or do defintions next?)
- Main menu, definitions coming soon?
- have difficulty settings?

2nd Version:
- Compare users score to other players

Pro version with extra game modes? Or just ads?:
- See which might generate more money?

Other Game Modes:
- Words that are often used to describe...
https://www.wordsapi.com/ https://www.datamuse.com/api/
Greek letters mode, scientific symbols?, generic symbols?

Maybe:
- Add you missed suggestions
- add a way for user to contest/suggest rhyme





Potential Tests to write:
- Rhymes:
  - When current rhyme index reaches buffer, additional rhymes are loaded
  - When there is no next rhyme, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in pregame state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
- Definitions:
  - When current definition index reaches buffer, additional definitions are loaded
  - When there is no next definition, connection error shows with retry
  - After retry success, new game is launched, in playing state
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request succeeds > new game starts with new definitions
  - Initial request succeeds > Game is playing > next request fails > retry succeeds > new game starts
  - Initial request fails > retry fails > retry succeeds > game starts



Name Ideas:
Word Play Challenge
Something like WordScapes/other word puns
