Calling API:
- call API on app load, store data in store
- can still have loading components in screens if API is slow but
  want API to be called as soon as app starts to reduce loader time

- Error handling

- Add tutorial

- make background animated spheres

- add random word display at top of screen

- call https://www.datamuse.com/api/ (e.g. https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=list)
- call API with each word, sort in order of most number of rhyming words
- split into easy, medium, hard groups


- If word is correct - it goes green and flies up
- if wrong it goes red and bounces to the left or right
- add timer, after timer runs out display new word

- Add score
- Add sound effects
- Timer in top left/right, X in top left/right
- Will need some main menu with mute also?

- show correct words somewhere and incorrect somewhere else?

- move all api results into my own db?

- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word
