----------------------------------------
1st Release
----------------------------------------

General
- add extra game mode coming soon disabled button (or add Synonyms?)

Design:
- Decide on colours/rough design before request
  - Think about changing background to be two separate interpolating colours (rather than moving from bottom to top)
- Request:
  - App Icon - Gradient + white monkey icon
  - Image/Icon for splash screen - App Icon + Word Monkey Text?
  - Top Bar Title - White monkey icon next to text?
  - Google play store feature image (1024w * 500h) - App Icon + Word monkey on one side, game screenshot on the other

Definitions:
- 

Rhymes:
- add info popup/tooltip about perfect rhymes with link to wiki
- review UI - answer grid item style, spacing on different screens, etc

Leaderboard/Stats:
- Improve UI for displaying rating on menu
  - maybe under button - small leaderboard icon: {score}

Bugs:
- see if it works running on device via android studio
- Look into shuffle again - is timing still ok?

Sound Effects:
  - test out different button sounds for menu buttons, short organic tap?
  - different button for back button vs menu buttons?
  - sound for settings button?
  - normalize sounds - negative a bit quieter
  - Post Game sounds
  - Rhyme game sounds

- Think about other ways to incorporate monkey theme:
  - ?

  - Add Game description to google play console


iOS Release:

- look through each screen again carefully/critically

Maybe in 1st release:

- Handle leaderboard connection if network is down
- error reporting/tracking? (react native sentry)
- force players to unlock harder difficulties?




----------------------------------------
Future Release
----------------------------------------

General:
- Versus Mode
- For iOS add animating spheres also, don't use linear gradient?
- enableProguardInReleaseBuilds, enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture ?
  - look into how to see bundle size/app/apk size https://medium.com/@rishii.kumar.chawda/reduce-your-react-native-app-size-dramatically-5430d773c92f
- Decide on next game mode, Science definitions? Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)
- upgrade react native
- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word
- does there need to be a timeout on the api?
- add X to loading state
- look into adding reselect
- look into making splash screen a gradient
- look into flipper/rn 0.62
- Set different themes in settings menu?
- Add gradient to splash screen?
- keep track of perfect streak
  -> change praise words based on this/show streak

Definitions:
- Look into whether rhymes all request approach would be better for definitions also (would increase response size)
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)
- on shuffle fade out answer letters when they disappear?

Rhymes:
- Make get ready text fade in
- fade out countdown at end of game
- fix title moving a tiny bit from pre game -> game
- handle duplicate answer (shimmer/flash animation?)

Potential Features:
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?, give example?, give synonym?)
- add background animated spheres
- Other user stats - % correct, longest streak?

Potential Tweaks:
- Change countdown to pie timer?

Potential Refactors:
- Sort out game and round naming (round should be within a game)
- make countdown logic generic?
- could move ON_EXIT_GAME logic to listen to navigation event instead of timeout
