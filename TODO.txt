----------------------------------------
Future Release
----------------------------------------

General:
- Versus Mode
- For iOS add animating spheres also, don't use linear gradient?
- enableProguardInReleaseBuilds, enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture ?
  - look into how to see bundle size/app/apk size https://medium.com/@rishii.kumar.chawda/reduce-your-react-native-app-size-dramatically-5430d773c92f
- Decide on next game mode, Science definitions? Synonyms? (pick correct from random list of words)
- upgrade react native
- need a way to track which users got which words, 
  or at least add a counter for number of users that got a particular word
- does there need to be a timeout on the api?
- add X to loading state
- look into adding reselect
- look into making splash screen a gradient

Definitions:
- Look into whether rhymes all request approach would be better for definitions also (would increase response size)
- look into performance profiling (is everything being re-rendered when countdown ticks?)
- on shuffle fade out answer letters when they disappear?

Rhymes:
- Make get ready text fade in

Potential Features:
- add clues? (2 clues per round? - give first X letters?, give example?, give synonym?)
- add background animated spheres

Potential Refactors:
- Sort out game and round naming (round should be within a game)
- make countdown logic generic?
- could move ON_EXIT_GAME logic to listen to navigation event instead of timeout
