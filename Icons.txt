Request Message:

Hi Muhammad,

I'm looking for a logo to use as the app icon and for the splash screen for an iOS & Android game I'm developing.

The game is a word puzzle game in which the player has to work out the
correct word from jumbled up letters given the definition of the word.
And there are also other modes involving rhyming and synonyms.

The name of the app is 'Word Monkey'.

For the logo/app icon I'm thinking it should be a monkey face, with minimalist design.
The monkey should look happy/friendly ideally.
The monkey could also be wearing glasses maybe, if that looks good, not sure.

The colour palette of the app is white text with purple/blue background so I think
the app icon should be like this too.
Though I may change the background colour so I would like the source file image of just the monkey
face logo with transparent background in case I need to change in future.

I will send some screenshots of the app as it currently looks for design inspiration.

Let me know if you need any more info about the app or anything else!

Thanks,
Jamie
